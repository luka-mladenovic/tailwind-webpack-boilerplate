# Webpack boilerplate for Tailwind CSS



Clone the project and install the dependencies using the `npm`:

```
npm install
```



Create a Tailwind config file (optional):

```
npx tailwind init tailwind.config.js
```



Compile the assets using the `npm run dev` command:

```
npm run dev
```



By default this will compile the `main` sass file inside the `assets\styles\sass` folder. Feel free to change the source files inside the `webpack.config.js` file as needed.
